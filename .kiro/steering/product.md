# Product Overview

This is a **Python Package MCP Server** - a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI coding agents with comprehensive awareness of Python package ecosystems.

## Core Purpose
Enables AI assistants to understand, analyze, and work with Python dependencies by providing three main capabilities:
- **Project Analysis**: Extract and analyze dependencies from requirements.txt and pyproject.toml files
- **Package Metadata**: Retrieve comprehensive package information from local installations and PyPI
- **Package Discovery**: Search PyPI for packages by functionality and keywords

## Key Features
- Local-first strategy (checks local installations before PyPI)
- Comprehensive error handling and health monitoring
- Structured logging with performance metrics
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Support for both development and production dependencies

## Target Users
AI coding agents and developers working with Python projects who need intelligent package ecosystem awareness.
