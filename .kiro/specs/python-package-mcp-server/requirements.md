# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a local Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI coding agents with comprehensive awareness of Python package ecosystems. The server will analyze project dependencies, extract package metadata, and expose this information through MCP tools to enable context-aware development suggestions and recommendations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using an AI coding agent, I want the agent to understand my project's Python dependencies, so that it can provide relevant suggestions and avoid recommending incompatible packages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Python project is analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify all direct dependencies from requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, setup.py, or Pipfile
2. WHEN dependencies are found THEN the system SHALL extract version constraints and specifications for each package
3. WHEN the agent queries for project dependencies THEN the system SHALL return a complete list with version information
4. IF a dependency file is modified THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the dependency information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI agent to access detailed metadata about packages in my project, so that it can understand package capabilities and suggest appropriate usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a package is identified as a dependency THEN the system SHALL retrieve metadata including description, author, license, and keywords from PyPI
2. WHEN package metadata is requested THEN the system SHALL return information about package functionality and use cases
3. WHEN multiple versions of a package exist THEN the system SHALL provide metadata for the version that matches project constraints
4. IF package metadata is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the error and provide available information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an AI coding agent, I want to query package compatibility and relationships, so that I can recommend compatible packages and identify potential conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying package compatibility THEN the system SHALL check version constraints against available package versions
2. WHEN analyzing dependencies THEN the system SHALL identify transitive dependencies and their relationships
3. WHEN a new package is being considered THEN the system SHALL validate compatibility with existing project dependencies
4. IF version conflicts are detected THEN the system SHALL report specific conflict details and suggest resolutions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to provide package search and discovery capabilities, so that the AI agent can suggest relevant packages for specific functionality needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching for packages by functionality THEN the system SHALL query PyPI and return relevant packages with descriptions
2. WHEN package suggestions are requested THEN the system SHALL rank results by popularity, maintenance status, and relevance
3. WHEN filtering search results THEN the system SHALL consider project's Python version compatibility
4. IF no suitable packages are found THEN the system SHALL provide alternative suggestions or indicate no matches

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an AI coding agent, I want to access basic package information and documentation links, so that I can provide accurate suggestions about package usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN package information is requested THEN the system SHALL provide links to official documentation and repositories
2. WHEN basic package details are needed THEN the system SHALL return description, homepage, and repository URLs
3. WHEN installation information is requested THEN the system SHALL provide package installation instructions
4. IF documentation links are not available THEN the system SHALL provide available package information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to work with basic Python project structures, so that it can analyze my project dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server analyzes a project THEN it SHALL detect and parse requirements.txt files
2. WHEN pyproject.toml files exist THEN the system SHALL extract dependencies from the [project.dependencies] section
3. WHEN project analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL return the current working directory's dependencies
4. IF no dependency files are found THEN the system SHALL return an empty dependency list
