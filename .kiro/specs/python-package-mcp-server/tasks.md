  - Add logic to handle both absolute and relative project paths
  - Return structured dependency information including file sources and version specifications
  - Add proper error handling for invalid paths and permission issues
  - Format response according to MCP tool response specification
  - Write integration tests for the MCP tool with different project path scenarios
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 6.3_

- [x] 8. Implement MCP tools for package metadata retrieval
  - Create get_package_metadata MCP tool that accepts package_name parameter

  - Add proper error handling for package not found scenarios in both local and remote sources
  - Format response with package information including documentation links
  - Write integration tests for the MCP tool with both locally installed and remote packages
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 9. Implement MCP tool for package search


  - Create search_packages MCP tool that accepts query parameter for package search

  - Return ranked search results with package names, descriptions, and latest versions
  - Add filtering and ranking of search results by relevance and popularity
  - Format response with package search results in structured format
  - Write integration tests for the search tool with various query types
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.4_

- [x] 10. Create server configuration and startup script
  - Implement server configuration handling for MCP server setup
